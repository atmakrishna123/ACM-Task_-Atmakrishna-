 Here we use the header file <math.h> because we use the pow() to find the power. Here we use the return type of teh function rangeBitwiseAnd() as int. We also take two integer values left and right as arguments. The count value is set to 0. The while loop keeps running unless the left and right values are the same. The left and right values get keeping updated as left=left/2 and right=right/2 after each iteration and the count value also gets incremented. Once the while loop terminates we return the value using the statemnet (left*pow(2,count)).
