Here we pass an integer value(a number) as argument. We return a value which is integer. The count value is set to 0 inside the function. The while loop keeps running as the condition n>0 is true. The count value changes to count=count+(n%2) every time the while condition is satisfied. Also the n value changes to n=n/2. In the end when the while condition gets violated we return the value of count which is the value of the number of bit sets of the binary number.
