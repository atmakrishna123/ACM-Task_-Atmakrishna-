Here we return the reverseBits() as unsigned int and the argumnet is also passed as unsigned int. The unsigned int datatype converts the binary number to its decimal representation. We then create a charchter array(String) to convert the number into its reversed way. For this we use a for loop where each index is obtained by (n%2). The number obtained is then converted to string by +'0'. We then assign the last index as '\0'. reverse and power are assigned values 0 and 1 respectively. Then using a for loop we check the given binary string from backwards , incase the charchter index is 1, we update the value in reverse. Everytime the for loop runs the value of power updates and in the end we return the reverse which returns the reverse bits of  a 32 unsigned integer.
