At first we define an inOrder() which takes a pointer root to a struct node. If the root is NULL then there are nodes to process qand hence function stops and returns. The inorder(root->left) acts as a recursion statement and calls the left part of the subtree. Then we ask to print the value of the root. Then we call the right part of the subtree. This is so because in Inorder traversal we first print the leftNodes, root and then the rightNodes.
