First line defines a function named removeDuplicates that takes a pointer to the head of a singly linked list and returns a pointer to the head of the modified list. We then use a pointer current which is initialized to the head of the current list. We then check if the list has atleast 2 elements and that they dont hve NULL values. While this condition is satisfied, we go for a if-else construct. Here we check if the current element and the next element are the same, if that is the case we create another pointer dupicate which is used to hold the refernce for the next node. We also update the next pointer of the current node to skip the duplicate and point to the next element. We then use free(duplicate) to deallocate the memory. If the if condition fails we change the value of current to the value of the next node.
