To the mergeLists() we pass 2 pointers namely head1 and head2 as arguments. Here the head1 points to the first eement of the first sorted List and head2 points to the first element of the second sorted List. If the value of head1 is NULL that is if the first list is empty we return the list 2.The same holds true if the value of head2 is NULL. We then declare another pointer mergedhead which is assigned the value NULL. Incase the value of head1 is less than or equal to the value of head2 we update the pointer mergedHead to point to head1. Then we again go for recursion and check compare the second element of list1 with first element of list2. Else we make the pointer mergedHead to point to head2 and via recursion we compare the first element of list 1 with second element of list 2. In the end we return the value of mergedHead.
